        <section id="intro-section">
          <p class="main-content">this is the first paragraph and it has a class of "main-content" you should make sure to add some classes to your work as well so that you can practice doing it!</p>
          <p class="main-content">here's a second paragraph that shares the same class as the first, so any style changes that are made to that class (or to the paragraph selector) will target both of these.</p>
          <br/> <!-- linebreak! -->
          <p>notice that this paragraph doesn't have a class. any style changes targetting the class "main-content" selector won't impact this, althought anything using the "p" selector will!</p>
          <p>hopefully your content is much more interesting and unique than this. this is rather meta though, eh!</p>
          <p>now that you've finished this section, lets move on to read some lists!</p>
          <hr id="split-one"/> <!-- horizontal rule is a line across page -->

      <h3>totally awesome lists!</h3>
        <section id="list-section">
          <p>i'm going to list out some html elements for your enjoyment</p>

            <li>the body!</li>

          <p>now let's list out some other things. maybe some really neat animals!</p>
          <ol class="second-list">
