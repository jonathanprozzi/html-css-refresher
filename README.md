make sure to not copy the code in this project. 
you should create your own based on the project guidelines:

      Proper HTML page skeleton. Check the Text Editor lesson if you need help remembering what this should include.
      At least 3 types of heading element (<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, etc). of your choice. Make sure that they make sense semantically; ie: donâ€™t use a <h4> tag as your main page header.
      At least 2 lists. Include both ordered and unordered lists.
      A paragraph <p> for each section. This should include relevant content!
      Include at least 4 images and/or links.
      Include 2 id properties and 2 class properties. These can be included on any HTML element of your choice.
      Experiment with including <div> and <span> elements!
      
      CSS:
      Link to your stylesheet (likely style.css) in the index.html file!
      Style the following elements: body, your main header, paragraph
